- IPFS Deployment with Fleek ```.fleek.json```

This repo is a conceptual starting point for building a multiplatform wallet or dapp. Based on [Capacitor boilerplate](https://github.com/rendyproklamanta/react-webpack-capacitor).

Please note: this repo isn't quite production ready as-is. Users will want to setup the endpoints and network, check ``config.example.ts``.

## Usage

Note: you will need a free Blockfrost Token ID or [Dandelion](https://blockfrost-api.testnet.dandelion.link) service by [PEACE Stake Pool](https://twitter.com/repsistance).

Build and export for all platforms:
```bash
    # Install
    npm i 
    # or
    npm i  --legacy-peer-dep
     
    # Run
    npm run dev
    # or
    yarn dev
    
    # For macos m1
    npm -g i sharp
```

All the client side files will be sent to the `./build/` directory. These files need to be copied to the native iOS and Android projects, and this is where Capacitor comes in:

### Platforms

#### Web
```bash
   yarn dev
```

#### Chromium Extension
```bash
1. Open chrome://extensions/ in chrome
2. Turn on Developer Mode.
3. Load ```build``` folder.
```

#### Mobile
```bash
    yarn buildcap
```

Finally, run the app:
```
    npx cap run ios
    npx cap run android
```

Or open Android Studio:
```
    npx cap open android
```
#### Desktop
Follow the instructions from the official site to setup [capacitor+electron](https://capacitor-community.github.io/electron/)
## Check Live logs
Open on browser and select ```inspect```:
```
    brave://inspect/#devices
```

## Livereload/Instant Refresh

To enable Livereload and Instant Refresh during development (when running `npm run dev`), find the IP address of your local interface (ex: `192.168.1.2`) and port your Next.js server is running on, and then set the server url config value to point to it in `capacitor.config.ts`:
```json
    {
      "server": {
        "url": "http://192.168.1.2:3000"
      }
    }
```
